The following people have commit access to the Sakai K2 sources.
Note that this is not a full list of Sakai K2's authors, however --
for that, you'd need to look over the log messages to see all the
patch contributors.

If you have a question or comment, it's probably best to mail
sakai-kernel@googlegroups.com, rather than mailing any of these
people directly.
