<h1>JDBC Persistance Experiment</h1>
This is an experiment that looks at what it would be like to perform persistance with JDBC. It uses the OpenSocial model as an
example of a fully developed model. The code here illustrates some of the issues, although it does not build.
<ul>
<li>It exposes SQL in properties files which is good for the DBA.</li>
<li>It requires a very large ammount of manual programming to achieve even basic ORM </li>
<li>Creating large objects is painful and error prone</li>
</ul>
